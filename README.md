## NAME MIXNODE
SCANDALIST

## MESSAGE
Hey! My name is Dmitry and I am a crypto enthusiast. My experience in the blockchain industry is already 3 years. I am learning and developing quickly in this field. At the moment I already have a good experience in running nodes, monitoring and maintaining them. I am a trusted validator of mainnet and also participate in the testnets of many projects. 
I joined NYM relatively recently, but was strongly inspired by the idea and spirit of the project. 
By launching my first MIxnode NYM, I want to actively contribute to the mission of ensuring privacy for all. I also want to help NYM become more decentralized, so I chose an unpopular but secure VPS hosting and launched my node in location Pakistan.

Come and delegate your NYM ü§ù
